Immediately after, we went to judging. We practiced what we were going to talk about before we went into judging. This extra practice was very helpful for our performance in the judging room. We talked about our mechanical design, software design, and outreach in detail, then opened the floor to judges. We performed very well in the judging room, so there are few things we need to critique for the future. \n\nAfter our successful presentation for the judges, it was time for the robot competition. Going into the first game, we were very confident, but a series of unfortunate events quickly unfolded. Our collection arm never shot out of our robot, we weren’t able to drop from hanging for a majority of our matches, and our robot kept disconnecting. This was all due to the lack of time given for the programmers to work on the software of the robot. We were not properly able to use all of the parts of our robot, so we had to take it almost completely apart. We performed better as time went on, but it was still not a very strong performance; certainly not how we thought it would go. Overall, this taught our team a valuable lesson; don’t procrastinate!\n\nAfter our poor robot performance at the competition, it is obvious that we need to use a new robot design, or give software more time to perfect the program. We will talk about specific changes in a future meeting."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2018-12-16T03:08:41.957Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":16}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"5b723fd01e6f235fa5ae8c1a","avatarHash":null,"avatarUrl":null,"fullName":"John","idMemberReferrer":"5b71bed8ac554009630bc786","initials":"J","username":"john06372487"}},{"id":"5c15c19511a3ce17a4b94e51","idMemberCreator":"5b723fd01e6f235fa5ae8c1a","data":{"list":{"name":"Miscellaneous","id":"5b9afb4bed96d66029f47c47"},"board":{"shortLink":"MOB4rciu","name":"Mechanical","id":"5b71bf1a82281f0d28353cdf"},"card":{"shortLink":"ZfMuc3vG","idShort":14,"id":"5c15c18a75d1ed6a07b76c8d","name":"Competition Reflections"},"old":{"name":"Competition Summaries"}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2018-12-16T03:08:05.743Z","limits":{},"memberCreator":{"id":"5b723fd01e6f235fa5ae8c1a","avatarHash":null,"avatarUrl":null,"fullName":"John","idMemberReferrer":"5b71bed8ac554009630bc786","initials":"J","username":"john06372487"}},{"id":"5c15c18a75d1ed6a07b76c8e","idMemberCreator":"5b723fd01e6f235fa5ae8c1a","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"MOB4rciu","name":"Mechanical","id":"5b71bf1a82281f0d28353cdf"},"list":{"name":"Miscellaneous","id":"5b9afb4bed96d66029f47c47"},"card":{"shortLink":"ZfMuc3vG","idShort":14,"name":"Competition Summaries","id":"5c15c18a75d1ed6a07b76c8d"}},"type":"createCard","date":"2018-12-16T03:07:54.566Z","limits":{},"memberCreator":{"id":"5b723fd01e6f235fa5ae8c1a","avatarHash":null,"avatarUrl":null,"fullName":"John","idMemberReferrer":"5b71bed8ac554009630bc786","initials":"J","username":"john06372487"}},{"id":"5c14ad600f7a2145e262ab3c","idMemberCreator":"5b71bed8ac554009630bc786","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"MOB4rciu","name":"Mechanical","id":"5b71bf1a82281f0d28353cdf"},"idMemberAdded":"5b7314389eb072493801066f","memberType":"normal"},"type":"addMemberToBoard","date":"2018-12-15T07:29:36.141Z","limits":{},"member":{"id":"5b7314389eb072493801066f","avatarHash":null,"avatarUrl":null,"fullName":"GraceV","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"G","username":"gracev6"},"memberCreator":{"id":"5b71bed8ac554009630bc786","avatarHash":null,"avatarUrl":null,"fullName":"Project Management","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"PM","username":"projectmanagement20981120"}},{"id":"5c1459c5f381496a2b77d4eb","idMemberCreator":"5b723fd01e6f235fa5ae8c1a","data":{"listAfter":{"name":"Abandoned","id":"5b91f626ee02bb5af485abd5"},"listBefore":{"name":"Concept","id":"5b91be8c667d0d54c89534b2"},"board":{"shortLink":"MOB4rciu","name":"Mechanical","id":"5b71bf1a82281f0d28353cdf"},"card":{"shortLink":"U7cFHhhe","idShort":11,"name":"Mini Shoop depositor","id":"5c00bfd585490f0c4c53f5ec","idList":"5b91f626ee02bb5af485abd5"},"old":{"idList":"5b91be8c667d0d54c89534b2"}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2018-12-15T01:32:53.501Z","limits":{},"memberCreator":{"id":"5b723fd01e6f235fa5ae8c1a","avatarHash":null,"avatarUrl":null,"fullName":"John","idMemberReferrer":"5b71bed8ac554009630bc786","initials":"J","username":"john06372487"}},{"id":"5c14508221d86e023a88d6ac","idMemberCreator":"5b723fd01e6f235fa5ae8c1a","data":{"listAfter":{"name":"Fail Test","id":"5b91f61030b77c1a30b96973"},"listBefore":{"name":"Abandoned","id":"5b91f626ee02bb5af485abd5"},"board":{"shortLink":"MOB4rciu","name":"Mechanical","id":"5b71bf1a82281f0d28353cdf"},"card":{"shortLink":"cnoVkLY7","idShort":8,"name":"Deposition Arm","id":"5bd63da6833dc71d32adeed3","idList":"5b91f61030b77c1a30b96973"},"old":{"idList":"5b91f626ee02bb5af485abd5"}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2018-12-15T00:53:22.185Z","limits":{},"memberCreator":{"id":"5b723fd01e6f235fa5ae8c1a","avatarHash":null,"avatarUrl":null,"fullName":"John","idMemberReferrer":"5b71bed8ac554009630bc786","initials":"J","username":"john06372487"}},{"id":"5c144670e536b1751f0c974f","idMemberCreator":"5b723fd01e6f235fa5ae8c1a","data":{"list":{"name":"Prototype","id":"5b91b26c034d1a7a31cd2caf"},"board":{"shortLink":"MOB4rciu","name":"Mechanical","id":"5b71bf1a82281f0d28353cdf"},"card":{"shortLink":"YWEwABMr","idShort":7,"name":"Collection Arm","id":"5baa9f60fa190f41f20edb20"},"text":"(12/13) After testing and tweaking lengths for various small details on the collection arm, we got it to work consistently. It always locked into the locking mechanism after ejection. We are not officially able to move on and work on the other pulley system, or we were going to.\n\nWe decided that using the pulley system to extend the collection arm might not work. We tried testing it using a mechanism that would only let rope in one way, but not the other. We tested it multiple times, but it didn't work. Instead, we decided to scrap the pulley on the side of our robot since we were running out of time.\n\nInstead of using a pulley system on the side of our robot, we permanently attached two c-channels on the bottom for the collection arm. We kept the collection mechanism mount on the top c-channel. So, we ended up permanently scrapping the extension pulley idea and replaced it with a single sliding c-channel system for the collection mechanism. \n\nSince we changed our collection arm, we decided that being able to detach the string from the collection arm was a nice quality-of-life change that we must make to improve the overall design. Instead of directly attaching the string to the collection arm, we attached the string to a carabiner clip. This would allow us to detach the string from the collection arm and attach it with ease compared to keeping it permanently attached. \n\nThere was also a lot of stress being put on the pulley attached to the linear actuator. To help reduce this immense amount of stress on a weak part of the robot, we added another pulley to the top-front of the robot. This would allow the collection arm better strength, while also decreasing stress on the motor. \n\nWe also reinforced the pulley system connected to the linear actuator much better by attaching an 'L' shaped piece of metal instead of a flat plate. This makes the whole collection pulley system much sturdier.

We did five trials with each of the three designs (wheels, zipties, zipties modified). We were immediately able to rule out the original ziptie design as the new one was more efficient.

So tonight I worked on removing the the spacers and the sides of the lift kit to make it tighter and added an extra standoff attached to the linear slide. By doing this it took away about half of the tilt when going up. But there still needed to be thicker padding for the wheels to run on to give the lift kit a stout way to go up. So for next meeting im going to add more padding to see if that fixes our tilt issue when trying to lift.\n\nAlso, I changed the lift kit motor from a 60:1 to a 128:1 motor to give the lift kit more torque for lifting. While doing this I had to adjust the chain since it wasn’t and offset gear box. Also I had to add a tensioner to make sure there was no slack in the chain."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2018-11-02T03:56:10.837Z","limits":{"reactions":{"perAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":900},"uniquePerAction":{"status":"ok","disableAt":17,"warnAt":16}}},"memberCreator":{"id":"5b7c63292957f5680f73c5fb","avatarHash":null,"avatarUrl":null,"fullName":"zachary","idMemberReferrer":"5b71bed8ac554009630bc786","initials":"Z","username":"zachary512"}},{"id":"5bdb92d0b868a518a2bfda19","idMemberCreator":"5b72ffe441c5dc42c025fda4","data":{"list":{"name":"Prototype","id":"5b91b26c034d1a7a31cd2caf"},"board":{"shortLink":"MOB4rciu","name":"Mechanical","id":"5b71bf1a82281f0d28353cdf"},"card":{"shortLink":"eBpouYlI","idShort":3,"name":"Shooper","id":"5b98218558fb533c16dd3aac"},"text":"We wanted to get a sweeper together, and began making it with zip ties.
